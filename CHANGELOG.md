# Changelog - Restaurant Swipe App

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Checkpoint 1.0.0] - 2025-01-24

### 🎯 Milestone: Working Basic Application

**Status**: ✅ Functional restaurant swipe app with dummy data

### ✨ Features Added
- **Tinder-style swipe interface** for restaurant discovery
- **Touch-friendly gestures** using react-swipeable library
- **Action buttons** (Like/Pass) as alternative to swiping
- **Dummy restaurant data** with 6 realistic entries for testing
- **Modern UI design** with cards, gradients, and animations
- **Loading states** with smooth animations
- **Liked restaurants tracking** and display
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile
- **Time-based filtering** (breakfast/lunch/dinner)
- **Rating-based sorting** (highest rated first)

### 🏗️ Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite for fast development
- **Backend**: Express.js with CORS enabled
- **API Integration**: Google Places API (with dummy fallback)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS3 with flexbox and animations
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Gesture Support**: react-swipeable for touch interactions

### 🚀 Architecture Decisions
- **Direct API calls**: Frontend calls backend directly (no proxy needed)
- **CORS enabled**: Simplified development without proxy complications
- **Dummy data first**: Immediate functionality without API dependencies
- **San Francisco default**: Fallback coordinates for geolocation issues
- **Port flexibility**: Automatic port selection to avoid conflicts

### 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Development

#### Major Issues Resolved:
1. **Multiple Vite Processes** 
   - Problem: Accumulating server processes causing port conflicts
   - Solution: Proper process cleanup and port management

2. **Proxy Configuration Hanging**
   - Problem: Vite proxy causing timeouts and hanging
   - Solution: Direct API calls with CORS instead of proxy

3. **Geolocation Blocking App**
   - Problem: App hanging on geolocation permission requests
   - Solution: Skip geolocation, use default coordinates

4. **JSX Structure Errors**
   - Problem: Missing closing div tags causing render failures
   - Solution: Proper JSX structure with React fragments

5. **CORS Issues**
   - Problem: Frontend couldn't access backend API
   - Solution: Enabled CORS on Express server

6. **Server Port Conflicts**
   - Problem: Multiple servers trying to use same ports
   - Solution: Automatic port selection and process cleanup

### 🔮 Known Limitations & Future Improvements

#### Current Limitations:
- **Static Dummy Data**: No real-time restaurant updates
- **Simple Filtering**: Basic time-based filtering only
- **No Persistence**: Liked restaurants reset on page refresh
- **Limited Photos**: Gradient placeholders for dummy data
- **Basic Geolocation**: No advanced location features

#### Planned Improvements:
